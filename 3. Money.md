# 3. Money Talks: Part 1

We live in a world where money is often seen as the ultimate ticket to happiness, success, and fulfillment. Phrases like "money can't buy happiness" or "money can't buy taste" are frequently thrown around, often as a means of tempering our expectations or justifying why we don’t have more. But are these just clichés, or do they hold some deeper truth about the role of money in our lives?

It's tempting to believe that more money will automatically bring us the life we’ve always dreamed of, but the reality is far more complex. Much like subscribing to Netflix, having more money seems like the solution to all our problems until we realize that the pursuit of money can be far less satisfying than we expect.

## a. The Allure of Money: The Netflix Analogy

(Not trashing Netflix, just because it is a common analogy)

Money, like a Netflix subscription, promises freedom. The allure is in the idea that you can do whatever you want, buy whatever you want, and live however you want. When you sign up for Netflix, you’re not just buying access to a catalog of movies and shows — you’re buying the idea of having unlimited choice, the illusion of endless entertainment possibilities at your fingertips. But once you’ve signed up, you might find yourself scrolling through the catalog, overwhelmed by the options, yet unable to settle on anything to watch. You thought you needed more choices, but the abundance of options only creates anxiety.

The same can be said for money. We often believe that more money will grant us the ability to do anything we want, but once we have it, the options can become overwhelming, and satisfaction isn’t guaranteed. The desire for more money doesn’t necessarily stem from a need for more things, but rather from the idea that more options will lead to more happiness, or that having more will somehow make us feel more complete. In reality, however, we can end up just as dissatisfied as we were before, only now with more things we don't use and more choices we can't make.

## b. The Fallacy of "More Money Equals a Better Life"

We tend to think of money as the answer to all our problems. If only we had more of it, we could quit our job, travel the world, buy a dream home, or afford better healthcare. And while money can undeniably provide comfort and opportunities, it doesn’t guarantee happiness or fulfillment. Accordint to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20823223/">research</a>, beyond a certain threshold — usually enough money to meet your basic needs and provide for a comfortable lifestyle — the correlation between money and happiness weakens significantly.

More money may grant us more freedom in theory, but it also tends to bring about new pressures and anxieties. With greater wealth comes greater responsibility: managing investments, handling expectations, and dealing with the societal pressures to maintain or increase your wealth. The joy of having financial security is often overshadowed by the fear of losing it. And ironically, the more money we accumulate, the more we may find ourselves consumed by the pursuit of even more.

## c. The Trap of Materialism

The relationship between money and happiness is complicated. When we don't have enough money, we feel constrained. But once we acquire more, we often fall into the trap of materialism — equating happiness with the acquisition of more goods and experiences. We get caught in a cycle of constantly upgrading to the next best thing, believing that the latest phone, car, or vacation will bring us joy, only to realize that the excitement is fleeting.

Material possessions can provide temporary satisfaction, but that satisfaction tends to diminish over time — a concept known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill">hedonic treadmill.</a> Essentially, the more we get, the more we want, and our baseline level of happiness doesn’t increase in the long term. The true fulfillment comes not from accumulating more, but from finding meaning and purpose in what we already have.

## Conclusion

My writing does not suggest that you should avoid striving to earn more or give up on the dream of becoming rich. Let's face it—being rich is undoubtedly appealing, and the freedom it brings is a powerful motivator. However, the purpose of this reflection is to offer a new perspective on money: money is a human construct, a system created and maintained by us through society’s intervention and agreement.

As of November 2024, the number of billionaires worldwide is approximately 3,000, while the number of millionaires is around 58 million. To put that into perspective:

As a millionaire, you are part of about 0.73% of the global population.
As a billionaire, you make up a tiny 0.000036% of the population (including those who inherited their wealth).
This doesn't imply that the remaining 99.27% of people are unhappy, nor does it mean that financial success is irrelevant. What it points to is the fact that wealth is a small percentage of the population, and yet the idea of having more money often overshadows the value of other aspects of life.

## Most People's Reaction

How would most people react to this ? According to my estimation :

- 0.001% of people: "WOW, THIS IS INSANE! This is the first time someone has presented such a perspective."

- 1% of people: "I've thought about this before. Maybe I should remember this perspective and focus on happiness every day while continuing to pursue wealth."

- 98.999% of people: "Who does he think he is? You won’t say the same thing if you had money. Money solves everything."
