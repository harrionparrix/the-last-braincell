# 2. 1984, George Orwell : Review

<b>This article is based on my personal experience and, therefore, is biased.</b>

I noticed "1984 (1949), George Orwell" among the top-rated fiction works on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/?ref=nav_home">Goodreads</a> and now, having read it, I can confidently say it deserves its legendary status. This novel is truly one of the greatest ever written—a literary masterpiece that invites deep reflection and discussion. 1984 should not just be read but thoroughly contemplated, as its themes remain hauntingly relevant. The manipulation of media to push one-sided propaganda and the relentless rewriting of history was the most disturbing element for me. It raises an unsettling question: will we ever achieve a state of “good,” or is humanity trapped in a cycle of self-destruction?

Personally, I avoid reading others’ reviews beforehand, as they often influence my own impressions—a rather insidious effect. Humans, as social creatures, have the remarkable ability to adapt their neural pathways in real-time. Even when we consciously reject certain information, if it’s repackaged—whether by someone we admire or as part of public opinion—we often accept it, labeling it as "growth."

So, do we treat 1984 as just a mainstream novel, or do we embrace it as a catalyst for conversation and reflection? While I believe we are still far from a true dystopia, there is clear evidence that elements of Orwell’s vision can—and do—exist in our world. 1984 challenges us to recognize these warning signs and to remain vigilant in preserving freedom and truth.

## (Mini Section) Animal Farm, George Orwell : Book Review

I picked up "Animal Farm (1985), George Orwell" on recommendation, and it exceeded my expectations with its brilliant storytelling and creative approach. Orwell’s mirroring of farm animals to key figures of the Russian Revolution is masterfully executed, presenting complex historical events in a simple yet powerful way. I especially appreciated how Orwell maintains a minimal bias in the narrative, allowing readers to observe the allegory unfold with subtle humor and irony. The farm-life metaphors are both funny and profound, highlighting the absurdities of power and corruption in a way that is both engaging and thought-provoking.

Overall, Animal Farm is a clever, satirical novel that skillfully captures both historical depth and literary wit.
