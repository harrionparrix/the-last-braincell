# 1. Right or Wrong ?

<b>This article is based on my personal experience and, therefore, is biased.</b>

The concepts of "right" and "wrong" are often presented as absolute, universal truths. We are taught from a young age what is right and what is wrong, based on societal norms, religious beliefs, or legal systems. But when we stop and think about it, one fundamental question arises: What truly defines right or wrong? Is there an inherent moral compass within us that can distinguish between the two? Or are these concepts simply human constructs?

## No Universal Definition

In my view, there is no objective, universally accepted definition of what is right or wrong. These terms are merely constructs that societies have agreed upon over time. What is considered "right" in one culture or era can be deemed "wrong" in another. For example, practices like slavery, women's suffrage, and capital punishment were once regarded as "right" by certain societies, but today they are largely seen as morally wrong in many parts of the world.

This historical shift prompts a fascinating thought: what actions or behaviors, considered "normal" today, might be viewed as "blunders in human history" by future generations?

This shows that what is "right" or "wrong" is fluid, not a fixed set of truths, but rather a reflection of collective agreements within societies or groups. We learn these concepts through education, laws, and family values. The reason we accept them is not because we inherently understand them as moral truths, but because they have been consistently reinforced by society. Over time, we internalize these principles and apply them to our everyday decisions.

## Emotions and Morality

If you steal a car tomorrow, you might feel guilty. But someone who has grown up in an environment where stealing was a common way of making ends meet might see it differently — they might view it as justified or even necessary.

For instance, if you are taught that lying is "wrong" but end up lying anyway, you might experience guilt. This feeling of guilt isn't something someone explicitly tells you to feel. Rather, it is an internal emotional response triggered by the conflict between your actions and the moral framework you have been taught. In this sense, your "moral compass" is not an innate truth but a learned reaction, one that depends on the values you have internalized throughout your life.

There is this famous experiment, of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_RpgSKxjwk">
Why aren't babies afraid of snakes?</a> by BBC. which explores how some fears might be innate, while others are learned. In the experiment, babies who had never encountered snakes were shown a snake for the first time. Despite the snake being a potentially dangerous animal, the babies did not exhibit the typical fear responses that adults might have, suggesting that fear of snakes is not inherently hardwired into us.

This aligns with the argument that emotions and moral judgments are shaped over time. While some basic survival instincts, like fear of certain dangers, may be innate, our complex emotional responses — including feelings of guilt, shame, or pride — are learned. Just as a baby is not born with a fear of snakes, we are not born with a predefined moral compass. Instead, we are taught and conditioned by society, family, culture, and experience to react to certain actions as right or wrong.
